# Topology

## Introduction

Creating this resource was mainly motivated by the need to thoroughly explain a handful of fundamental and important principals on subdivision modeling during rounds of feedback. Hopefully it can be helpful for fellow modelers. If you find that I am spewing nonsense, feel free to reach out at jakobjk@gmail.com and let me know what is up. Either way, I am always up for having a conversation regarding topology and workflows.

What Exactly is Subdivision Modeling! And blabla

## All Quads

One of the first advice you will encounter when getting started with Subdivision Modeling is to keep it "all quads". This is inherently not bad advice, but it does leave you with a false impression that if things are quadratic the geometry is correct. In order convey something can be amiss, even with all quads, is the simple
